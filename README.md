# The Barstool 


## Description

The Barstool is a simple application to search, save and learn how to make your favorite cocktails utilizing the distilled alocohol spirits you have available. 
We built this project to help novice cocktail makers explore the many options to make and save thier favorite drinks. It eases entry into what can be an overwhelming field of knowledge. We learned more about API usage, dynamically creating elements with Jquery and embedding video players. 

## How It Works

The user simply enters the spirit thep have available in the liquor search engine and click "search". The search result will generate a list of available drinks, their ingredients and a tutorial on how to make it. If the user decides to save it for later reference, they can click the "save" button. They will be saved for later reference under the "favorite drinks" tab.
